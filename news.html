            <h1>A message from Warren E Buffet</h1>
            <img src="media/Warren Buffett black and white.jpg" alt="Warren Buffet in black and white">
            <p>Dear Reader,</p>
            <p>You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However, I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries of Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's.</p>
            <p>I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO does.</p>
